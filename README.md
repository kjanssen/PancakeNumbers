PancakeNumbers is a number switching game written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. Actual source code is in src/com/dynet/kjanssen/PancakeNumbers.

The player is given a list of numbers from 1 to N in random order, such as: < 7 2 6 5 1 8 4 10 9 3 > and can reverse order of any block of numbers of arbitrary length in the list to end up with: < 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 >. The goal of the game is to do this in as few turns as possible.
