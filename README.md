PancakeNumbers is a number switching game written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

The player is given a list of numbers from 1 to N in random order, such as:

< 7 2 6 5 1 8 4 10 9 3 >

and can reverse order of any block of numbers in the list to end up with:

< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 >

The goal of the game is to do this in as few turns as possible.
